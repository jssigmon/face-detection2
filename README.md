# face-detection2

A prototype effort in animal face detection utilizing the OpenCV libraries.

Installation should just entail pulling the project to Android Studio, and loading it from there. I haven't tested that comprehensively, though.

Once installed, the app requires permissions to access the camera and to write to internal storage. You may have to toggle those manually.

Finally, the app may ask you to install OpenCV Manager. I had enough trouble with it downloading the wrong versions of the libraries to include them directly, so this likely won't happen, but be advised in case it does ask.
